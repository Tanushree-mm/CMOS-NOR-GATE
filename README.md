# CMOS-NOR-GATE

**OBJECTIVE**

Objective
Capture the schematic of a 2-input CMOS NOR Gate.

Verify the functionality of the NOR gate through simulation.

Measure the propagation delay for all four input combinations: 00, 01, 10, 11.

Tabulate the delay results obtained from simulation.

Scale the drive strength of the NOR gate to:

2X (double the transistor widths)

4X (quadruple the transistor widths)

Compare and tabulate the delay results for each drive strength.
